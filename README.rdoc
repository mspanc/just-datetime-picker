= Introduction

This is a simple gem for {Active Admin}[http://www.activeadmin.info] that just
adds support for Date/Time picker.

It supports both ActiveRecord for relational databases and {Mongoid}[http://www.mongoid.org]
for {MongoDB}[http://www.mongodb.org] schemaless database.

For Time picker widget, see {just-time-picker}[https://github.com/saepia/just-time-picker].

= Usage

== Code samples

Here comes a quick code sample. Sorry, currently no detailed docs.

That should create nice date/time picker for User#born_at. Associated column in the DB should be nullable.

To delete previously stored date/time just make all fields blank (date, hour and minute).

=== Migration (if you use ActiveRecord)

  class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :users do |t|
        t.datetime  :born_at

        t.timestamps
      end

    end
  end

=== Model

==== ActiveRecord

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    just_define_datetime_picker :born_at, add_to_attr_accessible: true
    validates :born_at, presence: true
  end

==== Mongoid

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :born_at, type: DateTime
    just_define_datetime_picker :born_at, add_to_attr_accessible: true
  end

You must place "mongoid" gem BEFORE "just-datetime-picker" gem in your Gemfile!

=== ActiveAdmin

  ActiveAdmin.register User do
    form do |f|
      f.inputs do
        f.input :born_at, as: :just_datetime_picker
      end

      f.buttons
    end
  end


= Installation

== Code itself

=== Gems

The gems are hosted at Rubygems.org[http://rubygems.org]. Make sure you're
using the latest version of rubygems:

  $ gem update --system

Then you can install the gem as follows:

  $ gem install just-datetime-picker

=== Bundler

Add to your Gemfile:

  gem "just-datetime-picker"

and then type:

  bundle install

=== From the GitHub source

The source code is available at https://github.com/saepia/just-datetime-picker.
You can either clone the git repository or download a tarball or zip file.
Once you have the source, you can unpack it and use from wherever you downloaded.

== Assets

=== CSS

If you use Rails >= 3.1 AND ActiveAdmin >= 0.5.0 just add this line to active_admin.css.scss

  @import "just_datetime_picker/base";

Otherwise, just manually append the code from {this file}[https://raw.github.com/saepia/just-datetime-picker/master/app/assets/stylesheets/just_datetime_picker/base.css]
to your CSS stylesheet.

In ActiveAdmin 0.4.x you must strip body.active_admin from CSS declarations.

=== JavaScript

If you use nested set and dynamically create date or date/time pickers,
they {won't be active by default due to bug in Active Admin}[https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/1651].

To overcome that, if you use Rails >= 3.1 just add this line to active_admin.js

  //= require just_datetime_picker/nested_form_workaround

Otherwise, just manually append the code from {this file}[https://raw.github.com/saepia/just-datetime-picker/master/app/assets/javascripts/just_datetime_picker/nested_form_workaround.js]
to your JS script.
